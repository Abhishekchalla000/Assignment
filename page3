    <big><p>Here are some notes to get you started with Java</p></big>
    <h2>Basics:</h2>
    <ul>
<li><b>Object-Oriented:</b>Java is an object-oriented programming language, meaning programs are built around objects that represent real-world entities.</li>
<li><b>Platform Independent:</b>Java code is compiled into bytecode, which can run on any platform with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This makes Java write once, run anywhere.</li>
<li><b>Syntax:</b>Java is an object-oriented programming language, meaning programs are built around objects that represent real-world entities.</li></li>
</ul><br>

<h2>Core Concepts:</h2>

<ol>
<li><b>Classes:</b>Classes are blueprints for creating objects. They define the properties (attributes) and functionalities (methods) of objects.</li>
<li><b>Objects:</b>Objects are instances of classes. They hold data (attribute values) and can perform actions (method calls).</li>
<li><b>Methods:</b> Methods are functions defined within a class that perform specific tasks on objects.</li>
<li><b>Data Types:</b> Java has primitive data types for basic values like integers, characters, and booleans, and non-primitive data types like Strings and arrays.</li>
</ol><br>

<h2>Learning Resources:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Java Tutorial:<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/" >https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/</a></li>
